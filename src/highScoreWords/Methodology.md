The methodology behind this method is to first, find very high scoring words.
(Words that are 15 letters down the left side).

Then find words that can connect to the word we have selected. Specifically 3 of
those words should be created when the triple space square is created to
maximize point gain.

Then place down our big word to see if it gets us a new high score. If it does
we then run a script that attempts to connect all the words in such a way that 
the game could theoretically be played. (I.E. all the words connect to the 
center).
